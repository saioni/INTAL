1. (i) INTAL is a non-negative integer of arbitrary length. The integer is stored as a null-terminated string of ascii characters. It is represented as a string of decimal digits that are stored in big-endian style (most significant digit is at the end of the string).
Example – integer 20 stored as – ‘2’ at s[0], ‘0’ at s[1] and null character at s[2].


(ii)Int data type has limited range of values possible. Unsigned long long int can range from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. This is the maximum number that we can use using int. 
     INTAL can support up to 1000 digits in our implementation.


(iii) Computation of probability, permutations and combinations. 
     Example – To find probability of winning the prize with one ticket. The number of combinations of 50 numbers taken 6 at a time, “50 choose 6”, is 50!/((50-6)!6!). That number is 15,890,700, so the odds of winning are 1/15,890,700. These numbers can be represented easily by a C integer, but the computation of that number involves computing 50!:30,414,093,201,713,378,043,612,608,166,064,768,844,377,641,568,960,512,000 this number will not fit into even a 64 bit C integer.
     INTAL can be applied in cryptology.


2. Implementations:

Addition – Brute Force approach implemented, padding of zeros for the smaller one and carry is added to each time addition is done.

Difference – Brute Force implemented, Similarly, borrow is subtracted each time.

Multiplication – Brute force, carry added each time.

Comparison – strcmp function is used to compare to 2 intals.

Mod – to compute intal1 mod intal2, difference function is used here, comparison made on the difference value and intal2 and based on it unpading function is called.

Pow – multiplication function used here to compute power

GCD – Mod function used here.

Fibonacci – iterative approach, addition function is used here.

Factorial – iterative approach, multiplication function is used here.

Maximum, Minimum – Comparison function is used to find max, min respectively in the array.

Search – Comparison function used here.

Sort – Merge sort (O(nlogn)) is implemented, helper functions used – merge, merge sort

Coin row problem – DP implemented.


3)         b) Parallel computing to achieve faster result.
